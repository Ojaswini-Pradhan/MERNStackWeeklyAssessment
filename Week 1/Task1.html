    <h1>Welcome to the Beach!</h1>

    <p>
        The beach is a fun place where you can feel the soft sand and hear the waves. 
        You can swim, make sandcastles, or just relax under the sun.

    <p>
        I love the beach because it is peaceful and beautiful. 
        The sound of the ocean makes me feel happy and calm.
